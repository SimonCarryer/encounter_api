swamp:
    - Tall trees emerge from the swamp
    - The swamp-water rises and falls with the tide
    - The swamp-water is an unusual colour - red, black, green
    - Flora is smothered by strange growths - moss, fungus, mold
    - The water ripples with writhing water-creatures - eels, frogs, or giant insect larvae
    - All the foliage is dead
    - Clouds of black flies swarm everywhere
    - There is a stink of marsh gas
    - An overwhelming feeling washes over the swamp - despair, sadness, guilt, exhaustion
    - Eerie lights flicker in the distance
    
mountains:
    - There is a risk of avalanches
    - Rare mountain flowers are in bloom
    - There is no tree-life
    - The slopes are covered in treacherous scree
    - Deep crevasses criss-cross the landscape
    - The streams are milk-white with glacier runoff
    - The wind creates endless, deafening howling
    - The whole mountain is a giant being - an elemental, a dragon, or something else
    - The mountain rumbles and shakes
    - The slopes are steep and perilous
    - There are deep and hidden valleys, filled with strange growth
