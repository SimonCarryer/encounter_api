forest:
    - Foliage or bark is an unusual colour - black, white, red
    - The trees are huge and towering
    - Forest grows close together in deep thickets
    - Undergrowth is sparse - there are many open clearings
    - Trees are conifers - with needle-like leaves
    - Vines tangle everywhere, making journeys difficult
    - Undergrowth is unusual - roses, mushrooms, a food crop
    - Murmuring voices can be heard - maybe it's just the wind
    - The trees are twisted and gnarled
    - Everything is blanketed with moss
    - Bird-life is strangely absent
    - Glowing insects emerge at dusk
    - Many clear pools are scattered through the woods
    - The trees are alive! This forest is guarded by one or more Treants
    - The wildlife is bizarre - huge, tiny, unusually intelligent, or alien
    - Many streams run through the woods
    - Abundant berries grow from thorny vines

swamp:
    - Tall trees emerge from the swamp
    - The swamp-water rises and falls with the tide
    - The swamp-water is an unusual colour - red, black, green

    - All the foliage is dead
    - Clouds of black flies swarm everywhere
    - There is a stink of marsh gas

    - The streams are milk-white with glacier runoff
    - The wind creates endless, deafening howling

    - The mountain rumbles and shakes
    - The slopes are steep and perilous
    - There are deep and hidden valleys, filled with strange growth
