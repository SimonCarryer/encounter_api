human empires:
    - Remains of a paved road
    - Tumbled-down stone walls
    - Out-of-place foliage - roses, an overgrown hedge-maze, an exotic tree
    - Old way-markers
    - Tumbled-down stone statues of fallen heroes
    - Overgrown paths with cracked pavers
    
dragons and giants:
    - Colossal statues, worn by ages
    - Enormous bones
    - Scars on the land - titans battled here
    - A swathe of bare land - burned black and lifeless eons ago
    - Remains of cyclopean architecture
    
first men:
    - Runes carved on rocks
    - Whispering voices in the trees
    - Animal life is strangely intelligent
